# Calculator
A calculator application built through the use of HTML, CSS, and JS

Looking back on this project, the hardest obstacle I had to overcome when trying to complete it was actually starting it.

When I was trying to create the actual layout of the calculator inside HTML and CSS, I had a very hard time trying to actually create the image of 
a calculator. I think the main reason why I was so worked up on the image part of the calculator and not the function of it was because I wanted
everything to be perfect on the get-go.

This is actually a very big problem for me. Whenever I start a project, I wanted everything to be perfect along the way, with no setback whatsover.
However, trying to make it perfect initally just made me overthink what I was doing, and not ACTUALLY coding the calculator.
My strive for perfection resulted in me procrastinating, which is why it took longer than it should have.

My thoughts for perfection got worse once I looked at other people's calculator (big mistake right there) and I just felt so tiny and not qualified
for this whatsover.

However, I needed to get over my thoughts of perfection. If I just kept thinking what it looked like, I will never get anything done.
So I just dived into making the calculator, not actually caring how it looked like. I needed to actually DO it, and then I can worry about my imperfections later.

I finished the calculator now, and I am proud to say that I am extremely proud of the result. It might not be as fancy as the others, but it 
WORKS, and that's the most important part. I even managed to do the extra credit they asked like having a decimal and backspace button. I even
went a little extra, and added a sign button, and transiton effect.

So my advice to others? When caught in the web of perfection, just dive into it. You'll reach for perfection that way instead of thinking
of it.
